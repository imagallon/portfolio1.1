## Description

  This is a major update to my existing  portfolio. I refined the look of the page using CSS framework, as well as tinkering with my stylesheet. I wanted to build this because I want to be able to show future employers work that I have done. This is the easiest way to demonstrate my skills as a developer. Working on this project allowed me to become more familiar with going through and reading documentation for CSS Frameworks.
